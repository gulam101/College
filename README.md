### Description: 

In college we had our first lesson in C#. We had to learn the basics of C# and learn how to use Visual Studio. We created this by following along with how the teacher does it and then we create it by following the instructions that he created for the project. 

Created in 5 minutes and the teacher was showing us different things we could do. This project was simple but my tutot was telling us that simple projects like these would be easy to work with and they don't cause any problems. He told us that we could add this onto our portfolio.

This exercise was teaching students how to use the windows form application. For example, in this tutorial we followed we had to create buttons and make an image move by simply moving the buttons. 

Because I already acquired some knowledge in C#, this took me only a few minutes. People who were new to the concept of programming spent 20-25 minutes creating this application.

### Prerequisites:

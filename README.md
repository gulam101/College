### Description: 

Created in college in 5 minutes. Teacher was showing us different things we could do.

This exercise was teaching students how to use the windows form application. For example, in this tutorial we followed we had to create buttons and make an image move by simply moving the buttons. 

Because I already acquired some knowledge in C#, this took me only a few minutes. People who were new to the concept of programming spent 20-25 minutes creating this application.

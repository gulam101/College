### Description: 

In college we had our first lesson in C#. We had to learn the basics of C# and learn how to use Visual Studio. This project allows the user to move an image, which is there by default and can't be replaced, by using the buttons and attaching a piece of code that allows the picture to move up, left, right and down. We created this by following along with how the teacher does it and then we create it by following the instructions that he created for the project. 

Created in 5 minutes and the teacher was showing us different things we could do. This project was simple, but my tutor was telling us that simple projects like these would be easy to work with and they don't cause any problems. He told us that we could add this onto our portfolio. This exercise was teaching students how to use the windows form application. For example, in this tutorial we followed we had to create buttons and make an image move by simply moving the buttons. 

### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2017+ (Recommended 2019)
- Windows 10 (OS)

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Download Visual Studio (If you don't have already)
- Step 2: Clone this project
- Step 3: Once downloading is finished, open it up using Visual Studio
- Step 4: Click run at the top and the application will run
- Step 5: Use the buttons to move the image around


### What I learned:
- Windows Standard Form
- Basics to C#
- Basics to Software Lifecycle

### Constraints:

Like I said before, I did have a problem with Visual Studio because I was new and the PC kept on crashing because it utilaised old hardware. However, I managed to solve the problem of Visual Studio by Googling my problems. As for the PC crashing I managed to close the services that were taking most of the RAM and this made it stable.
